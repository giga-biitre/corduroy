  The waiting drove me mad<br></br>
You're finally here and I'm a mess<br></br>
I take your entrance back<br></br>
Can't let you roam inside my head<br></br>
I don't want to take what you can give<br></br>
I would rather starve than eat your bread<br></br>
I would rather run but I can't walk<br></br>
Guess I'll lay alone just like before<br></br>
I'll take the varmint's path<br></br>
Oh, and I must refuse your test<br></br>
A-push me and I will resist<br></br>
This behavior's not unique<br></br>
I don't want to hear from those who know<br></br>
They can buy but can't put on my clothes<br></br>
I don't want to limp for them to walk<br></br>
Never would have known of me before<br></br>
I don't want to be held in your debt<br></br>
I'll pay it off in blood let I be wed<br></br>
I'm already cut up and half dead<br></br>
I'll end up alone like I began<br></br>
Everything has chains, absolutely nothing's changed<br></br>
Take my hand, not my picture, spilled my tincture<br></br>
I don't want to take what you can give<br></br>
I would rather starve than eat your breast<br></br>
All the things that others want for me<br></br>
Can't buy what I want because it's free<br></br>
Can't buy what I want because it's free<br></br>
Can't be what you want because I<br></br>
Why ain't it supposed to be just fun?<br></br>
Oh, to live and die, let it be done<br></br>
I figure I'll be damned<br></br>
All alone like I began<br></br>
